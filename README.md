# Art-Book


Libraries Used
--------------
* [Espresso][1] - This guide covers installing Espresso using the SDK Manager and building it using Gradle.
* [Lifecycles][2] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
* [Navigation][3] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
* [Coroutines][4] - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [Room][5] - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Glide][6] - Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* [Retrofit][7] - for turns your HTTP API into a Java interface
* [Dagger-Hilt][8] - Hilt is the recommended solution for dependency injection in Android apps, and works seamlessly with Compose.

Test Libraries Used
--------------
* [Hamcrest][9] - Variance is defined on the abstract Matcher type and Kotlin makes sure composition and subtyping work together the way you expect.
* [Robolectric][10] - Robolectric is the industry-standard unit testing framework for Android. With Robolectric, your tests run in a simulated Android environment inside a JVM, without the overhead and flakiness of an emulator.
* [Coroutines][4] - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [Truth][11] - Truth makes your test assertions and failure messages more readable. Similar to AssertJ, it natively supports many JDK and Guava types, and it is extensible to others.
* [Mockito][12] - Mockito-Kotlin's test suite is located in a separate tests module, to allow running the tests using several Kotlin versions whilst still keeping the base module at a recent version.
